Welcome to this Deep Learning lecture.

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:05,200
My name is Vincent, and
I'm a research scientist at Google,

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,519
working on machine learning and
artificial intelligence.

4
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:11,809
Deep Learning is an exciting branch
of machine learning that uses data,

5
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:12,870
lots of data,

6
00:00:12,869 --> 00:00:16,939
to teach computers how to do things
only humans were capable of before.

7
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:19,800
Myself, I'm very interested in
solving the problem of perception,

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,105
recognizing what's in an image what
people are saying when they're talking

9
00:00:23,105 --> 00:00:27,329
on their phone, helping robots explore
the world and interact with it.

10
00:00:27,329 --> 00:00:30,449
Deep Learning has emerged as
a central tool to solve perception

11
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:32,339
problems in recent years.

12
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,550
It's the state of the art on everything
having to do with computer vision and

13
00:00:35,549 --> 00:00:37,089
speech recognition.

14
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:38,370
But there is more.

15
00:00:38,369 --> 00:00:41,250
Increasingly, people are finding
that Deep Learning is a much better

16
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:45,149
tool to solve problems, like discovering
new medicines, understanding natural

17
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:49,949
language, understanding documents, and,
for example, ranking them for search.

18
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:52,050
So let's take a look at what
you'll be doing during this class.
