1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:05,870
Imagine that your valuation set has just
six examples with an accuracy of 66%.

2
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:08,150
Now you tweak your model and

3
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:14,520
your performance goes from 66% to 83%,
is this something you can trust?

4
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:19,020
No of course, this is only a change
of label for a single example.

5
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,850
It could just be noise.

6
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:24,710
The bigger you test set, the less noisy
the accuracy measurement will be.

7
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,150
Here is a useful rule of thumb.

8
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:30,880
And if you're a statistician,
feel free to cover your ears right now.

9
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:37,110
A change that affects 30 examples in
your validation set, one way or another,

10
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:40,360
is usually statistically significant,
and typically can be trusted.
