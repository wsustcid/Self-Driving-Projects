1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:03,380
I'm not going to talk about
cross validation here, but

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:05,850
if you've never encountered
it in your curriculum,

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:09,290
I'd strongly recommend
that you learn about it.

4
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:12,230
I am spending time on this because
it's essential to deep learning

5
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:13,810
in particular.

6
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:16,340
Deep learning has many knobs
that you can tweak, and

7
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:19,770
you will be tempted to
tweak them over and over.

8
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:23,240
You have to be very careful about
overfitting on your test set.

9
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,110
Use the validation set.

10
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:28,630
How big does your validation and
test sets need to be?

11
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:29,240
It depends.

12
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,330
The bigger your validation set
the more precise your numbers will be.
