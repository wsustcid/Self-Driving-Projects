00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:01,650
Many companies today,

2
00:00:01,649 --> 00:00:04,919
have made deep learning a central part
of their mission learning toolkit.

3
00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:09,400
Facebook, Baidu, Microsoft and Google,
are all using deep learning in their

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,980
products and
pushing the research forward.

5
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:15,919
It's easy to understand why, deep
learning shines wherever there is lots

6
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:18,379
of data and complex problems to solve.

7
00:00:18,379 --> 00:00:21,379
And all these companies are facing
lots of complicated problems.

8
00:00:21,379 --> 00:00:24,099
Understanding what's in an image,
to help you find it.

9
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:27,230
Or translating a document into
another language that you can speak.

10
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:33,259
This class will explore a continuum
of complexity from very simple models

11
00:00:33,259 --> 00:00:36,179
to very large ones that you will
still be able to train in minutes

12
00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:39,600
on your personal computer
to very elaborate tasks.

13
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,750
Predicting the meaning of words or
classifying images.

14
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,740
One of the nice things about deep
learning is it's really a family of

15
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:49,390
techniques that adapts to all sorts
of data and all sorts of problems.

16
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:52,689
All using a common infrastructure and
a common langauge to describe things.

17
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:55,920
When I began working
in machine learning,

18
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,340
I was doing research
on speech recognition.

19
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:00,910
Whenever I met someone
working on computer vision or

20
00:01:00,909 --> 00:01:04,450
natural langauge processing, we had
very little in common to talk about.

21
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:07,409
We used different acronyms,
different techniques, and

22
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:09,759
collaboration was
pretty much impossible.

23
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,660
Deep learning really changed that.

24
00:01:11,659 --> 00:01:14,479
The basic things that you will learn
in this class are applicable to

25
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:18,469
almost everything and will give you
a foundation that you can apply to many,

26
00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:20,239
many different fields.

27
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:24,009
You'll be part of a fast growing
community of researchers, engineers and

28
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:27,780
data scientists who share a common,
very powerful set of tools.
