00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:04,660
In the coming lectures, I'll talk about
these tools that compute the derivatives

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:08,350
for you, and a lot about what's good and
bad about grading descent.

3
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:12,770
For the moment, though, we'll assume
that I give you the optimizer as a black

4
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:14,060
box that you can simply use.

5
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:18,090
There are two last practical things
that stand in your way of training

6
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:18,690
your first model.

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:23,049
First is how do you fill image
pixels to this classifier and

8
00:00:23,049 --> 00:00:25,830
then where do you initialize
the optimization?

9
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:26,630
Let's look into this.
