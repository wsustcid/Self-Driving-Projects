00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,490
A lot of the important work on neural
networks happen in the 80s and

2
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:09,269
in the 90s, but back then computers
were slow and data sets very tiny.

3
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:13,059
The research didn't really find many
applications in the real world.

4
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:17,500
As a result, in the first decade of
the 21st century, neural networks have

5
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,670
completely disappeared from
the world of machine learning.

6
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:23,910
Working on neural networks
was definitely fringe.

7
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:27,920
It's only in the last few years,
first in speech recognition around 2009,

8
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,929
and then in computer vision around 2012,

9
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:32,850
that neural networks
made a big comeback.

10
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,179
What changed?

11
00:00:35,179 --> 00:00:38,850
Lots of data, and cheap and fast GPUs.

12
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:40,649
Today, neural networks are everywhere.

13
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:43,460
So if you're doing anything with data,
analytics, or

14
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:47,179
prediction, they're definitely something
that you want to get familiar with.

15
00:00:47,179 --> 00:00:47,950
So let's get started.
