1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,678
Next, we need a way to represent
our labels mathematically.

2
00:00:03,678 --> 00:00:07,749
We just said, let's have the
probabilities for the correct class be

3
00:00:07,748 --> 00:00:11,762
close to one and the probability for
all the others be close to zero.

4
00:00:11,762 --> 00:00:13,663
We can write down exactly that.

5
00:00:13,663 --> 00:00:16,548
Each label will be
represented by a vector,

6
00:00:16,548 --> 00:00:20,760
that is as long as there are classes and
it has the value 1.0 for

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,339
the correct class and
zero everywhere else.

8
00:00:24,339 --> 00:00:26,269
This is often called one-hot encoding.
