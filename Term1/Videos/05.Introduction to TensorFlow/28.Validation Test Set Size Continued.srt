1
00:00:00,118 --> 00:00:03,831
If your accuracy changes
from 80% to 80.1%,

2
00:00:03,831 --> 00:00:08,045
that's only at most three
examples changing their labels.

3
00:00:08,045 --> 00:00:11,330
It's 0.1 x 3000 divided by 100.

4
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:13,360
That's very few.

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,190
It could just be noise.

6
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:19,030
And it definitely doesn't meet my
rule of thumb of 30 examples minimum.

7
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:23,048
Same thing going from 80% to 80.5%.

8
00:00:23,048 --> 00:00:26,580
At worst,
only 15 examples are changing then.

9
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:31,260
When you get an improvement of 1%
going from 80% to 81%, that's now

10
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:37,940
a more robust 30 examples that
are going from incorrect to correct.

11
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:41,450
That's a stronger signal that whatever
you're doing is indeed improving your

12
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:41,970
accuracy.
