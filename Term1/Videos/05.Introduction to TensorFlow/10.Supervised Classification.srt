1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:05,929
This entire course, I'm going to focus
on the problem of classification.

2
00:00:05,929 --> 00:00:10,489
Classification is the task of taking
an input, like this letter, and

3
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:12,769
giving it a label that says this is a B.

4
00:00:14,169 --> 00:00:18,009
The typical setting is that you have
a lot of examples, called the training

5
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:23,850
sets, that have already been sorted in
this is an A, this is a B, and so on.

6
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:26,100
Now here is a completely new example,
and

7
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:30,480
your goal is going to be to figure out
which of those classes it belongs to.

8
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,649
There is a lot more to machine
learning then just classification, but

9
00:00:33,649 --> 00:00:34,659
classification, or

10
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:39,369
marginally prediction, is the central
building block of machine learning.

11
00:00:39,369 --> 00:00:42,589
Once you know how to classify things,
it's very easy, for

12
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:46,680
example, to learn how to detect them or
to rank them.
