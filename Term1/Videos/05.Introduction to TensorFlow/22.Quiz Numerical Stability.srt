00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,450
This is where we have to talk
a bit about numerical stability.

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:07,100
When you do numerical computations,
you always have to worry a bit about

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:10,650
calculating values that are too large or
too small.

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:14,300
In particular, adding very small values

5
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:18,300
to a very large value can
introduce a lot of errors.

6
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:19,640
Try this in Python.

7
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:24,205
Take the value 1,000,000,000 and then
add to it the value 10 to the minus 6

8
00:00:24,205 --> 00:00:28,760
1,000,000 times,
then subtract 1,000,000,000 again.

9
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:29,270
What do you get?
