1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,680
Let's do some back of
the envelope calculations.

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:06,459
Imagine you have 3,000 examples
in your variation set, and

3
00:00:06,459 --> 00:00:09,008
assume you trust my
hand wavey rule of 30.

4
00:00:09,008 --> 00:00:14,006
Which level of accuracy improvement
can you trust to not be in the notice?

5
00:00:14,006 --> 00:00:19,326
A difference from 80% to 81%,
a difference from 80%

6
00:00:19,326 --> 00:00:24,151
to 80.5%, a difference of 80% to 80.1%?
