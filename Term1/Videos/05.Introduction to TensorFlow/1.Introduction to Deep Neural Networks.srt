1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,000
Once again we're in the fortunate
position to be able to bring

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,998
a world expert into the classroom.

3
00:00:04,998 --> 00:00:08,342
Vincent Vanhoucke is the the principal
scientist of Google's deep learning

4
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:11,440
team, and he'll teach you the
fundamentals of deep neural networks.

5
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:16,450
&gt;&gt; Vincent will cover the jump from
machine learning to deep learning,

6
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:19,880
the architecture of multilayer
deep neural networks and

7
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:23,560
the concepts underpinning
convolutional neural networks.

8
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:27,607
A convolutional neural network is a
specialized type of deep neural network

9
00:00:27,607 --> 00:00:31,347
that turns out to be particularly
important for self-driving cars.

10
00:00:31,347 --> 00:00:34,633
At the end of the this section,
you'll use the TensorFlow deep

11
00:00:34,633 --> 00:00:38,169
learning library to build your
own convolutional neural network.

12
00:00:38,169 --> 00:00:41,658
&gt;&gt; Within the course, you'll see
optional assignments which are designed

13
00:00:41,658 --> 00:00:43,490
to familiarize you with TensorFlow.

14
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:45,750
These assignments are a great
way to get more practice and

15
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:46,860
stand out to employers.

16
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:51,610
&gt;&gt; First things first, let's learn from
Vincent about how to take what you know

17
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:55,660
about machine learning and use it
as an entry point to deep learning.

18
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:56,570
We'll see you when you finish.
