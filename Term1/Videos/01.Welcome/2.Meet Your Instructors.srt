00:00:00,121 --> 00:00:06,379
[SOUND]
&gt;&gt; Here are my colleagues,

2
00:00:06,379 --> 00:00:07,191
David and Ryan.

3
00:00:07,191 --> 00:00:12,424
David used to work at Ford as a engineer
before he joined as an instructor.

4
00:00:12,424 --> 00:00:16,360
And Ryan is a recovering astrophysicist,
who was looking for outer space,

5
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:19,532
couldn't find them and
joined us as an instructor here at.

6
00:00:19,532 --> 00:00:21,390
&gt;&gt; Awesome, thanks Sebastian.

7
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,320
&gt;&gt; So the most exciting part of this
course is that at the end of the course

8
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,130
you'll be able to put your own
code on a real self driving car.

9
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:31,410
In fact,
it's that car right there behind us.

10
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:33,480
&gt;&gt; That's right, so
welcome to the program.

11
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,540
You and I are going to be learning
together to write code to drive a car.

12
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,135
We're going to have David and
Sebastian looking after us.

13
00:00:39,135 --> 00:00:43,165
And we will be bringing in industry
experts to join us in the class room as

14
00:00:43,165 --> 00:00:43,576
well.

15
00:00:43,576 --> 00:00:44,659
&gt;&gt; All right.
