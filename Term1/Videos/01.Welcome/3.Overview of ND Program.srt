00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:04,460
Self-driving car engineers today use
two distinct approaches to autonomous

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:09,080
development, a robotics approach,
and a deep learning approach.

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:13,730
The robotics approach fuses output from
a suite of sensors to directly measure

4
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:16,535
the vehicle's surroundings,
and then navigate accordingly.

5
00:00:16,535 --> 00:00:19,380
Self-driving car engineers
have been working on and

6
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,509
perfecting the robotics approach for
many years.

7
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:25,710
&gt;&gt; More recently, engineering teams
have begun to use deep learning

8
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:28,530
as a different approach to
developing autonomous vehicles.

9
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:32,000
Deep neural networks allow self-driving
cars to learn how to drive

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,370
by mimicking human driving behavior.

11
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:37,601
Both the robotics and deep learning
methods are actively being pursued today

12
00:00:37,601 --> 00:00:40,040
in the development of self-driving cars.

13
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:45,230
&gt;&gt; So in this Nanodegree program,
you'll be working with both approaches.

14
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:49,720
That way you, as an engineer,
will be prepared to work anywhere.

15
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,880
By the end of this program you'll
be teaming up with other students

16
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,980
to actually write both robotics and

17
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:58,600
deep learning code to control
a real self-driving car.

18
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,453
Pretty cool.

19
00:00:59,453 --> 00:01:02,603
&gt;&gt; Along the way you'll work through
several modules, with each one focusing

20
00:01:02,603 --> 00:01:05,880
on a different layer of
the self-driving car technology stack.

21
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:06,980
And after each module,

22
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:09,590
you'll build a project to
demonstrate what you've learned.

23
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:12,100
And you'll get real human
feedback on your work.

24
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,370
This first module that you're
going through now is smaller and

25
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:16,840
should only take a week or
so to complete.

26
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,459
Later modules will be longer and
may take up to a month.

27
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,440
In addition to receiving human
feedback on your projects,

28
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,950
you'll also have access to the forums,
where you can ask questions and

29
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:29,700
get to know your fellow students.

30
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,420
And of course,
our team is here to help you succeed, so

31
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,120
be sure to reach out and keep in touch.
