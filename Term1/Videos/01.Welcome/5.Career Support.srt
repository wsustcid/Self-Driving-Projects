00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,280
We're here with Kirsten from
the Udacity careers team.

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,460
Kirsten and her team will be providing
you with career support throughout

3
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:10,120
the program in your effort to find
a job in the self driving car industry.

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:13,500
They'll help to ensure your application
materials are polished, you're ready for

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,620
interviews and you're connected
to employers in the field.

6
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:20,250
We'll also be taking you behind the
scenes at top auto manufacturers to get

7
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,670
an idea of what they're looking for
and how the hiring process works.

8
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:26,960
&gt;&gt; In addition to this course, we're
working with more than a dozen hiring

9
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,720
partners about our
leaders in this field,

10
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,540
such as Mercedes Benz, nVidia,
BMW, Otto, Di Di, and many more.

11
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,510
We're also working with
software companies,

12
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:39,280
radar and lidar manufacturers, and
many others that are searching for

13
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,580
top talent in this growing field.

14
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:45,870
Having hiring partners like these means
that you, as a student, have direct and

15
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:48,150
preferential exposure
at these companies,

16
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:51,250
which will give you a significant
advantage in your job search.

17
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:54,730
&gt;&gt; Kirsten is just one of the many
dedicated people here at Udacity

18
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:57,580
that you'll interact with
throughout the program.

19
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:02,930
You'll also have reviewers, mentors,
other students, career staff,

20
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:08,080
hiring partners, and of course,
Ryan and me, to help you along the way.

21
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,140
It's these people that will help
you make the most of your Udacity

22
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:15,420
experience, and so, on behalf of
all of us, welcome to the program.
