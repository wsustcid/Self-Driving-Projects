00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,893
Now we're going to introduce you to
a high-level framework called Keras that

2
00:00:03,893 --> 00:00:06,741
sits on top of TensorFlow and
provides a simplified interface.

3
00:00:06,741 --> 00:00:08,010
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that sounds great.

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:10,960
At Auto, if we need a lot of flexibility
and we really want to customize

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,880
the layer creation,
we'll go straight to TensorFlow.

6
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,530
But sometimes we can get everything we
need out of a frontend interface like

7
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:17,240
Keras.

8
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,710
And it makes building the network so
much faster and cleaner.

9
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:21,240
&gt;&gt; All right, well,
let's go check out Keras.
