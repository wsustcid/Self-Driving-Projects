00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:01,990
Congratulations!

2
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:05,950
You've built neural networks form
scratch, you've mastered tensor flow,

3
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:09,260
and now we're going to show you how
to build and train a multi-layer,

4
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:13,450
convolutional neural network
in even fewer lines of code.

5
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:14,340
In this lesson,

6
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:18,240
we'll be introducing an interface
that sits on top of tensor flow and

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,130
allows you to draw on the power of
tensor flow with far more concise code.

8
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:23,580
&gt;&gt; That's right,

9
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:27,760
in this lesson you'll be building a deep
neural network using a new set of tools.

10
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,870
You'll still have tensor
flow under the hood, but

11
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:32,740
with an interface that makes testing and
prototyping much faster.
