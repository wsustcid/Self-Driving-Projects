00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,060
The work we just did, building and

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:04,740
training a multi-layer
convolutional neural network,

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:07,640
would have taken hundreds of lines
of code just a few years ago.

4
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:08,340
&gt;&gt; That's right.

5
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,840
As deep neural networks become
increasingly important to everything

6
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:14,170
from self driving cars to voice
recognition, new libraries are making it

7
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:16,990
much easier to use deep learning
to solve real problems.

8
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:20,000
&gt;&gt; Next up, you are going to learn
how to take networks that have

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,870
already been trained and fine tune
them to accelerate your own work.

10
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:25,620
This is called transfer learning.

11
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,900
&gt;&gt; Transfer learning is
a standard tool in deep learning.

12
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,820
It can really reduce your training
time and improve your results.

13
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:31,350
&gt;&gt; See you soon.
