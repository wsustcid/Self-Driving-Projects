00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,300
In this code cell,

2
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:02,838
we set up another pipeline,

3
00:00:02,838 --> 00:00:04,740
this time for evaluating the model.

4
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:08,200
The training pipeline we just set up is what trains the model,

5
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:13,155
but the evaluation pipeline we create here will evaluate how good the model is.

6
00:00:13,155 --> 00:00:16,440
The first step in this pipeline is to measure whether a given prediction is

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:21,700
correct by comparing the logit prediction to the one-hot encoded ground truth label.

8
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:24,210
The second step in the pipeline is to calculate

9
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:29,460
the model's overall accuracy by averaging the individual prediction accuracies.

10
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,025
These two lines are the entire evaluation pipeline.

11
00:00:33,025 --> 00:00:35,790
But in order to run this evaluation pipeline,

12
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:38,460
we have to build an evaluate function.

13
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,725
This function takes a dataset as input,

14
00:00:40,725 --> 00:00:42,870
sets some initial variables,

15
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:47,175
and then batches the dataset and runs it through the evaluation pipeline.

16
00:00:47,175 --> 00:00:50,040
The evaluate function averages the accuracy of

17
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,270
each batch to calculate the total accuracy of the model.
