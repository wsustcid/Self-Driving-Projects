1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,635
The very last code cell evaluates the model on our test dataset.

2
00:00:04,635 --> 00:00:09,120
Remember, we should only run the model on the test dataset one time,

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,540
once we are completely done with training.

4
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:16,080
Otherwise, we would be using the test dataset to choose the best model and

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,850
then the test dataset wouldn't provide

6
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:21,050
a good estimate of how well the model would do in the real world.

7
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:24,755
So I'm not going to run this model on the test dataset right now.

8
00:00:24,755 --> 00:00:27,150
You can do it when you're ready.

9
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:29,730
That's the entire LeNet Lab end to end,

10
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,310
and if you understand how this lab works,

11
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:36,000
then you're ready to apply LeNet to the traffic sign classifier project.
