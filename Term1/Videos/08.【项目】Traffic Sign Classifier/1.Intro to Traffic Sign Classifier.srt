00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,730
I hope you enjoyed learning about
neural networks and convolutions.

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:07,830
So far you've been learning about deep
neural networks at the conceptual level,

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:12,410
and applying these techniques to
a range of image classification tasks.

4
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:16,260
In the next project you are going
to return to autonomous driving.

5
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,160
That's right, next you are going
to build a deep neural network

6
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,990
to classify traffic signs.

7
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:24,600
Your network should be able to take
an image and decide if it's a stop sign,

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,360
a yield sign, a different type of sign,
or maybe no sign at all.

9
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:31,550
&gt;&gt; This will be a terrific portfolio
project to demonstrate for

10
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:35,620
employers your hands-on practical
experience with deep neural network.
