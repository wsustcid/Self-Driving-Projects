1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,800
Now, let's focus on just the region
of the image that interests us.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,480
Mainly, the region where
the lane lines are.

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:10,970
In this case, you can assume that
the camera that took the image

4
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:14,270
is mounted at a fixed position
on the front of the car.

5
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:17,550
Therefore, the lane lines will
always appear in the same general

6
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:18,350
region of the image.
