00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:04,130
Looking at a grey scale image,
I see bright points, dark points, and

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:06,000
all the grey in between.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,190
Rapid changes in brightness
are where we find the edges.

4
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:12,020
Our image is just a mathematical
function of x and y so

5
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:15,830
we can perform mathematical operations
on it, just like any other function.

6
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:18,030
For example, we can take its derivative,

7
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:21,060
which is just a measure of
change of this function.

8
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:22,780
A small derivative means small change.

9
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:24,138
Big derivative, big chance.

10
00:00:24,138 --> 00:00:26,160
Images are two-dimensional so

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,590
it makes sense to take the derivative
with respect to x and y simultaneously.

12
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:32,240
This is called the gradient and

13
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:36,450
in computing it, we're measuring how
fast pixel values are changing at each

14
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:40,770
point in an image and in which direction
they are changing most rapidly.

15
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:43,390
Computing the gradient
gives us thick edges.

16
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:46,830
With the Canny algorithm we will
thin out these edges to find just

17
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:50,510
the individual pixels that
follow the strongest gradients.

18
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:53,680
We'll then extend those strong edges
to include pixels all the way down to

19
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,760
a lower threshold that we defined
when calling the Canny function.
