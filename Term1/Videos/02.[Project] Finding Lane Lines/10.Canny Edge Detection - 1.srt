00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,665
The name Canny refers to John F Canny
who developed this edge detection

2
00:00:04,665 --> 00:00:06,188
algorithm in 1986.

3
00:00:06,188 --> 00:00:07,381
With edge detection,

4
00:00:07,381 --> 00:00:11,390
the goal is to identify the boundaries
of an object in an image.

5
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:14,419
So to do that, first,
I'll convert to grayscale.

6
00:00:14,419 --> 00:00:19,410
[SOUND] All right and next,
I'll compute the gradient.

7
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:22,448
[SOUND] Nice, okay.

8
00:00:22,448 --> 00:00:26,848
So now, you're looking at the gradient
of my world, where the brightness of

9
00:00:26,848 --> 00:00:30,858
each pixel corresponds to the strength
of the gradient at that point.

10
00:00:30,858 --> 00:00:34,778
We're going to find edges by tracing out
the pixels that follow the strongest

11
00:00:34,778 --> 00:00:36,330
gradients.

12
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:39,388
All right, but the gradient world's a
little scary, so let's go back to color.

13
00:00:39,388 --> 00:00:41,597
[SOUND] By identifying edges,

14
00:00:41,597 --> 00:00:45,316
we can more easily detect
objects by their shape.

15
00:00:45,316 --> 00:00:47,700
So what exactly is an edge?

16
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,500
Let's first get some intuition by
having a look at the parameters for

17
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,175
the open CV Canny function.

18
00:00:52,175 --> 00:00:53,975
You'll call it like this.

19
00:00:53,975 --> 00:00:57,678
In this case, I'm applying the Canny
function to an image called gray and

20
00:00:57,678 --> 00:01:00,200
the output will be another image called,
edges.

21
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,107
Low_threshold and

22
00:01:01,107 --> 00:01:04,364
high_threshold determine how strong
the edges must be to be detected.

23
00:01:05,455 --> 00:01:08,815
You can think of the strength of an edge
as being defined by how different

24
00:01:08,815 --> 00:01:11,480
the values are in adjacent
pixels in the image.

25
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,580
Really just the strength
of the gradient.

26
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:16,650
Next, I'll show you how that works so
that you have a clear picture of what's

27
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:21,590
going on under the hood when you use the
Canny edge detection method in OpenCV.
