00:00:00,267 --> 00:00:04,656
When we talk about computer vision,
we're literally talking about using

2
00:00:04,656 --> 00:00:08,012
algorithms to let a computer
see the world like we see it.

3
00:00:08,012 --> 00:00:11,211
Full of depth, and color,
and shapes, and meaning.

4
00:00:11,211 --> 00:00:13,851
Computer vision is
a really broad field and

5
00:00:13,851 --> 00:00:17,090
right now we're just going to
focus on a few features.

6
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:21,704
Later in the nanodegree program,
we'll be getting much more in depth with

7
00:00:21,704 --> 00:00:26,190
the tools and techniques used in
computer vision for self driving cars.

8
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:29,842
&gt;&gt; At this point we'll introduce you to
two powerful techniques that you'll use

9
00:00:29,842 --> 00:00:33,439
for your first project where you'll be
identifying the lane lines in an image

10
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:34,063
of the road.

11
00:00:34,063 --> 00:00:36,952
The first technique we'll look
at is Canny Edge Detection.

12
00:00:36,952 --> 00:00:37,690
So let's give it a go.
