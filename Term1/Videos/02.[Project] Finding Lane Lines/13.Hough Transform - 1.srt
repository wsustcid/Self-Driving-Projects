00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,469
Okay so
now I've taken a grayscaled image, and

2
00:00:03,469 --> 00:00:07,000
using edge detection, turned it
into an image full of dots, but

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,820
only the dots that represent
edges in the original image.

4
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:12,650
Now let's connect the dots.

5
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:15,640
I could connect the dots to look for
any kind of shape in my image, but

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,910
in this case I'm looking for lines.

7
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,234
To find lines I need to first
adopt a model of a line, and

8
00:00:21,234 --> 00:00:26,050
then fit that model to the assortment
of dots in my edge detected image.

9
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:28,720
Keeping in mind that my image
is just a function of x and y,

10
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,990
I can use the old familiar
equation of a line y = mx + b.

11
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:38,230
In this case, my model includes
two parameters, m and b.

12
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:41,990
In Image Space,
a line is plotted as x versus y.

13
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:45,550
But in parameter space,
which we will call Hough Space,

14
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:49,615
I can represent that same
line as m versus b instead.

15
00:00:49,615 --> 00:00:52,595
The Hough transform is just
the conversion from Image Space

16
00:00:52,595 --> 00:00:53,775
to Hough Space.

17
00:00:53,775 --> 00:00:56,515
So the characterization
of a line in Image Space,

18
00:00:56,515 --> 00:01:00,205
will be a single point at
the position mb in Hough Space.
