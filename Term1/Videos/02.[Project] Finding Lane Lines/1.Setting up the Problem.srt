1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,110
Your job is to teach the car
how to drive itself.

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:06,360
And in order to do that you're going to
need to teach the car how to perceive

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:07,980
the world around it.

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,590
Now when I drive I use my eyes
to figure out how fast to go and

5
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:14,335
where the lane lines are and
where to turn.

6
00:00:14,335 --> 00:00:18,665
A car doesn't have eyes, but in a
self-driving car we can use cameras and

7
00:00:18,665 --> 00:00:21,235
other sensors to achieve
a similar function.

8
00:00:21,235 --> 00:00:21,805
&gt;&gt; That's right, so

9
00:00:21,805 --> 00:00:25,625
let's think about what those cameras
are seeing as we drive down the road.

10
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:28,175
You and I can see where the lane
lines are automatically, but

11
00:00:28,175 --> 00:00:30,515
we need to teach the car how to do that.

12
00:00:30,515 --> 00:00:34,475
So your goal in this first module,
is to write code to identify and

13
00:00:34,475 --> 00:00:37,069
track the position of the lane
lines in a series of images.

14
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:40,890
&gt;&gt; And in the project at
the end of this first module,

15
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:44,670
you're going to use image analysis
techniques to do exactly that.

16
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:47,210
So let's start really high level.

17
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:50,400
Here's a picture of a stretch
of wide open highway.

18
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,120
What kinds of features do
you think would be helpful

19
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,670
to figure out where the lane
lines are in this image?
