00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,950
Great job so far.

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:05,380
In this lesson, you've used image
analysis techniques like canny

3
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:10,140
edge detection and huff transforms
to find lane lines in images.

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:12,720
These are the exact same techniques
that you're going to need for

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:13,890
the first project.

6
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:17,140
So, Ryan, what will students be
doing for the first project?

7
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:21,213
&gt;&gt; Well, your goal, in this first
project, is to write a software pipeline

8
00:00:21,213 --> 00:00:25,106
to identify and track the position
of the lane lines in a video stream.

9
00:00:25,106 --> 00:00:28,523
That might sound complicated,
but don't worry, you can do it.

10
00:00:28,523 --> 00:00:31,239
A video is really just
a series of images.

11
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:35,186
So you already have the tools
you need to do this project.

12
00:00:35,186 --> 00:00:36,304
&gt;&gt; Awesome.

13
00:00:36,304 --> 00:00:40,228
This project is your first step toward
becoming a real self-driving car

14
00:00:40,228 --> 00:00:40,879
engineer.

15
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:44,544
And, in fact, this was one of my first
projects when I was learning to become

16
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,111
a self-driving car engineer.

17
00:00:46,111 --> 00:00:46,810
So let's get to it.
