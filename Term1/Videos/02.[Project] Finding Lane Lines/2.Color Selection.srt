00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:04,420
For starters, let's try finding
the lane lines using color.

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:09,058
The lane lines are white, so how do we
select the white pixels in an image?

3
00:00:09,058 --> 00:00:13,342
To select a color, we first need to
think about what color actually means in

4
00:00:13,342 --> 00:00:14,979
the case of digital images.

5
00:00:14,979 --> 00:00:18,938
In this case, it means that our image
is actually made up of a stack of

6
00:00:18,938 --> 00:00:22,730
three images, one each for
red, green, and blue.

7
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:25,620
These images are sometimes
called color channels.

8
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:31,270
Each of these color channels contains
pixels whose values range from 0 to 255,

9
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:36,510
where 0 is the darkest possible value,
and 255 is the brightest possible value.

10
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:40,230
If 0 is dark and 255 is bright,

11
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:44,230
what color would represent pure white in
our combined red, green, and blue image?
