The idea is very simple.

00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:05,129
If your data has some structure,
and your network doesn't

3
00:00:05,129 --> 00:00:08,699
have to learn that structure from
scratch, it's going to perform better.

4
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:12,850
Imagine, for example, that you're
trying to classify those letters, and

5
00:00:12,849 --> 00:00:18,119
you know that color is really not
a factor in what makes an A an A.

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,289
What do you think would be easier for
your classifier to learn?

7
00:00:21,289 --> 00:00:26,190
A model that uses the color image, or a
model that only looks at the gray scale?
