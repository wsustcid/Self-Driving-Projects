1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:03,960
If you're using the so
called same padding in a stride of 1,

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:07,009
the output width and
height are the same as the input.

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:12,440
We just add zeros to the input
image to make the sizes match.

4
00:00:13,449 --> 00:00:14,119
If you use th so

5
00:00:14,119 --> 00:00:19,009
called valid padding in a stride of one,
then there is no padding at all.

6
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:22,400
So if you want to fit your little filter
on the input image without doing and

7
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:25,449
padding, you're going to
have to remove one row and

8
00:00:25,449 --> 00:00:29,239
one column of the image on each side.

9
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:32,929
So you're left with 26 features in
each of the maps at the output.

10
00:00:34,109 --> 00:00:36,409
If in addition you use a stride of two,

11
00:00:36,409 --> 00:00:41,739
then you only get half as many outputs
So, 13 in width and 13 in height.

12
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:44,039
In all cases,
the output depth isn't changed.
