1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:04,070
Imagine that you have a 28 by 28 image.

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:08,730
You run a 3 by 3 convolution on it,
with an input depth of 3,

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:10,370
and an output depth of 8.

4
00:00:10,369 --> 00:00:14,029
What other dimensions
are your output feature maps?

5
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:18,359
When you're using same
padding with a stride of 1.

6
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:22,289
When you're using valid
padding with a stride of 1.

7
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:25,009
And when you're using valid
padding with a stride of two.
