00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,849
Now let's say we're the admissions
office at a university, and

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:04,980
we're trying to figure out
which students to admit.

3
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:09,780
We're going to admit them or reject
them based on two pieces of information,

4
00:00:10,869 --> 00:00:14,769
an entrance test we provide them,
and their grades from school.

5
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:20,460
So for example, here we have student
one with scores of nine in test and

6
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:23,589
eight in the grades, and
that student got accepted.

7
00:00:23,589 --> 00:00:27,179
We also have student two with
scores of three in the test and

8
00:00:27,179 --> 00:00:30,789
four in the grades and
that student did not get accepted.

9
00:00:30,789 --> 00:00:33,119
And then a new student comes in,
student three.

10
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:35,459
This person scores seven and six, and

11
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,009
the question is should we accept them or
not?

12
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:43,564
So to decide this, let's first put them
in a grid where the x axis represents

13
00:00:43,564 --> 00:00:46,500
the score on the test and
the y axis represents the grades.

14
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:50,619
Here we can see that student one
would lie over here on the point with

15
00:00:50,619 --> 00:00:54,479
coordinates nine, eight, and

16
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:59,849
student two would lie over here in the
point with coordinates three and four.

17
00:01:00,859 --> 00:01:02,570
So in order to see if
we should accept or

18
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:06,000
reject student three,
we'll try to find the trend in the data.

19
00:01:07,189 --> 00:01:10,280
For this we'll look at previous data in
the form of all students we've already

20
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,950
accepted or rejected.

21
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:14,490
It turns out that the previous
data looks like this.

22
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:19,049
The green dots represent students
that was previously accepted and

23
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:21,969
the red dots represent students
that was previously rejected.

24
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:25,079
Okay, so time for a quiz.

25
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:29,329
Based on this previous data do we
think student three gets accepted?

26
00:01:29,329 --> 00:01:31,159
Yes or no?

00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:32,549
