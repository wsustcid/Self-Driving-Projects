00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,410
The nice thing about L2 Regularization
is that it’s very, very simple.

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:06,689
Because you just add it your loss,

3
00:00:06,689 --> 00:00:09,580
the structure of your network
doesn’t have to change.

4
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:12,370
You can even compute
its derivative by hand.

5
00:00:12,369 --> 00:00:14,549
Remember that the L2 norm stands for

6
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:18,800
the sum of the squares of
the individual elements in a vector.

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,908
Which of these formulas gives you
the derivative of L2 norm of a vector?
