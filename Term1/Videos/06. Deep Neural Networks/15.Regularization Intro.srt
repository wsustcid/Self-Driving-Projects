00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:04,564
Why did we not figure out earlier
that t-models were effective?

2
00:00:04,564 --> 00:00:08,310
Many reasons, but mostly because
t-models only really shine if you

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:09,680
have enough data to train them.

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:14,610
It's only in recent years that large
enough data sets have made their way to

5
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:15,360
the academic world.

6
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:22,260
We'll look at another reason now,
we know better today how to train very,

7
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,080
very big models using better
regularization techniques.

8
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,300
There is a general issue when you're
doing numerical optimization which I

9
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,530
call the skinny jeans problem.

10
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:34,820
Skinny jeans look great,
they fit perfectly, but they're really,

11
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:36,490
really hard to get into.

12
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:39,200
So most people end up wearing
jeans that are just a bit too big.

13
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,450
It's exactly the same
with deep networks.

14
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:45,760
The network that's just the right
size for your data is very,

15
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,880
very hard to optimize.

16
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:52,300
So in practice, we always try networks
that are way too big for our data and

17
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,920
then we try our best to
prevent them from overfitting.
