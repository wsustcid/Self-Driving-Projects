1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:04,640
Yes, I could talk about neural
networks as metaphors for the brain.

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,210
It's nice and it might even be true,
but it comes with a lot of baggage and

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:11,420
it can sometimes lead you astray.

4
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:13,200
So I'm not going to talk about
it at all in this course.

5
00:00:14,305 --> 00:00:16,114
No need to be a wizard nor a scientist.

6
00:00:16,114 --> 00:00:20,405
New networks naturally make sense
if you're simply a lazy engineer

7
00:00:20,405 --> 00:00:23,355
with a big GPU who just wants
machine learning to work better.

8
00:00:24,395 --> 00:00:26,275
Now, though,
is a good time to talk about the math.
