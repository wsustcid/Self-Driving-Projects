1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,945
That's very powerful.

2
00:00:01,945 --> 00:00:05,684
As long as you know how to write the derivatives of your individual functions,

3
00:00:05,684 --> 00:00:08,009
there is a simple graphical way to combine them

4
00:00:08,009 --> 00:00:12,044
together and compute the derivative for the whole function.

5
00:00:12,044 --> 00:00:15,039
There's even better news for the computer scientist than you.

6
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:18,899
There is a way to write this chain rule that is very efficient computationally,

7
00:00:18,899 --> 00:00:23,000
with lots of data reuse and that looks like a very simple data pipeline.
