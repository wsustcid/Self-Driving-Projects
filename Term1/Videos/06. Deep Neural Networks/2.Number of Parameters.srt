The simple model that you've trained so
far is nice, but

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:05,450
it's also relatively limited.

3
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:07,080
Here is a question for you.

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,940
How many train parameters
did it actually have?

5
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:16,680
As a reminder, each input was a 28 by 28
image, and the output was 10 classes.

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,040
Enter the number of parameters here.
