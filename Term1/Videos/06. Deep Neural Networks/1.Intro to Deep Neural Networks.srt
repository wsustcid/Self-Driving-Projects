00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
In the last lesson we've trained a simple logistic classifier on images.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,650
Now we're going to take this classifier and turn

3
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:10,199
it into a deep network and it's going to be

4
00:00:10,199 --> 00:00:12,689
just a few lines of code so make sure you

5
00:00:12,689 --> 00:00:16,175
understand well what was going on in the previous model.

6
00:00:16,175 --> 00:00:19,149
In the second part you're going to take a small peek

7
00:00:19,149 --> 00:00:22,524
into how our optimizer does all the hard work for you,

8
00:00:22,524 --> 00:00:25,379
computing gradients for arbitrary functions.

9
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:28,910
And then we're going to look together at the important topic of

10
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:34,380
regularisation which will enable us to train much much larger models.
