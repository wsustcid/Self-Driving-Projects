1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,520
So now you have a small neural network.

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:05,359
It's not particularly deep,
just 2 layers.

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:06,610
You can make it bigger,

4
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:10,429
more complex by increasing the size of
that hidden layer in the middle, but

5
00:00:10,429 --> 00:00:15,000
it turns out that increasing this H is
not particularly efficient in general.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,160
You need to make it very, very big,
and then it gets really hard to train.

7
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,809
This is where the central idea of
deep learning comes into play,

8
00:00:22,809 --> 00:00:26,369
instead you can also add more layers and
make your model deeper.

9
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:28,560
There are lots of good
reasons to do that.

10
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:30,559
One is parameter efficiency.

11
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:34,908
You can typically get much more
performance with pure parameters by

12
00:00:34,908 --> 00:00:37,201
going deeper, rather than wider.

13
00:00:37,201 --> 00:00:39,618
Another one is that a lot
of natural phenomena,

14
00:00:39,618 --> 00:00:41,310
that you might be interested in,

15
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:45,917
tend to have a hierarchical structure
which deep models naturally capture.

16
00:00:45,917 --> 00:00:47,539
If you poke at a model for images, for

17
00:00:47,539 --> 00:00:50,229
example, and
visualize what the model learns

18
00:00:50,229 --> 00:00:55,339
you'll often find very simple things at
the lowest layers, like lines or edges.

19
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:56,440
Once you move up,

20
00:00:56,439 --> 00:00:59,820
you tend to see more complicated
things like geometric shapes.

21
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,640
Go further up, and you start
seeing things like objects, faces.

22
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:07,188
This is very powerful, because
the model structure matches the kind

23
00:01:07,188 --> 00:01:10,368
of abstractions that you might
expect to see in your data, and

24
00:01:10,367 --> 00:01:13,197
as a result the model has
an easier time learning them.

25
00:01:13,197 --> 00:01:15,068
