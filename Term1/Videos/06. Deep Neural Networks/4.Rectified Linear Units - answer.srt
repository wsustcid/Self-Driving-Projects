1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:03,680
When x is less than zero,
the value is 0.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,790
So, the derivative is 0 as well.

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:10,720
When x is greater than 0,
the value is equal to x.

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,500
So, the derivative is equal to 1.

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,360
The second answer is the right answer.
