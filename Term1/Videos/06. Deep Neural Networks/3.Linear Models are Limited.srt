1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,705
That's the case in general,

2
00:00:01,705 --> 00:00:04,709
if you have any inputs and k outputs,

3
00:00:04,709 --> 00:00:09,865
you have n+1 time K parameters to use, not one more.

4
00:00:09,865 --> 00:00:14,894
The thing is, you might want to use many many more parameters in practice.

5
00:00:14,894 --> 00:00:16,675
Also it's linear.

6
00:00:16,675 --> 00:00:19,155
This means that the kind of interactions that you're capable

7
00:00:19,155 --> 00:00:22,375
of representing with that model is somewhat limited.

8
00:00:22,375 --> 00:00:26,760
For example, if two inputs interact in an additive way,

9
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,785
your model can represent them well as a matrix multiply.

10
00:00:29,785 --> 00:00:34,420
But if two inputs interact in a way that the outcome depends on the product of the two,

11
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:38,835
for example, you won't be able to model that efficiently with a linear model.

12
00:00:38,835 --> 00:00:41,700
Linear operations are really nice though.

13
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,810
Big matrix multiplies are exactly what GPUs were designed for.

14
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:48,750
They're relatively cheap and very very fast.

15
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:52,560
Numerically linear operations are very stable.

16
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,049
You can show mathematically that small changes in

17
00:00:55,049 --> 00:00:59,365
the input can never yield big changes in the output.

18
00:00:59,365 --> 00:01:01,365
The derivatives are very nice too.

19
00:01:01,365 --> 00:01:04,560
The derivative of a linear function is constant.

20
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,920
You can't get more stable numerically than a constant.

21
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,605
So we would like to keep our parameters inside big linear functions,

22
00:01:11,605 --> 00:01:15,420
but we would also want the entire model to be non-linear.

23
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:18,060
We can't just keep multiplying our inputs by

24
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:22,750
linear functions because that's just equivalent to one big linear function.

25
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:26,000
So we're going to have to introduce non-linearities.
