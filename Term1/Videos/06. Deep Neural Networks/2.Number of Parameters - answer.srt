1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:05,850
The matrix, W, here, takes, as an input,
the entire image, so 28x28 pixels.

2
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:12,358
The output is of size 10, so
the other dimension of the matrix is 10.

3
00:00:12,358 --> 00:00:15,090
The biases are just 1x10.

4
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:19,750
So the total number of
parameters are 28x28x10,

5
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:23,724
plus another ten, that gives you 7,850.
