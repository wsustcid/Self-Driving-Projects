Let me introduce you to the lazy
engineer's favorite non-linear function:

2
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:07,060
the rectified linear units,
or RELU for short.

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,440
RELUs are literally the simplest
non-linear functions you can think of.

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:17,960
They're linear if x is greater than 0,
and they're the 0 everywhere else.

5
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,830
RELUs have nice derivatives, as well.

6
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:24,390
Which of these plots do you think best
represents the derivative of a RELU?
