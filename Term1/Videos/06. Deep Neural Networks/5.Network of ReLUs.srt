1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,035
Because we're lazy engineers,

2
00:00:02,035 --> 00:00:03,825
we're going to take something that works-

3
00:00:03,825 --> 00:00:08,065
our logistic classifier and do the minimal amount of change to make it nonlinear.

4
00:00:08,065 --> 00:00:12,832
We're going to construct our new function in the simplest way that we can think of.

5
00:00:12,832 --> 00:00:16,680
Instead of having a single matrix multiply as our classifier,

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,845
we're going to insert a ReLU right in the middle.

7
00:00:19,845 --> 00:00:21,555
We now have two matrices,

8
00:00:21,555 --> 00:00:24,420
one going from the inputs to the ReLUs

9
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,815
and another one connecting the ReLUs to the classifier.

10
00:00:27,815 --> 00:00:29,700
We've solved two of our problems.

11
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,350
Our function is now nonlinear,

12
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:33,045
thanks to the ReLU in the middle,

13
00:00:33,045 --> 00:00:36,795
and we now have a new knob that we can tune this number H

14
00:00:36,795 --> 00:00:41,040
which corresponds to the number of ReLU units that we have in the classifier.

15
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,900
We can make it as big as we want.

16
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,480
Congratulations you've built your first neural network.
