00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:04,280
Now that you've seen the concepts
behind regression, classification and

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:07,490
neural networks,
you're ready to start building.

3
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:08,420
&gt;&gt; In the next lab,

4
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:12,080
you're going to move from the high level
concepts down to the low level details.

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,300
You'll build your own
neural network library and

6
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:15,979
implement back propagation by hand.

7
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:20,000
&gt;&gt; Back propagation is
a pretty mind bending concept.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,170
And I remember how coding it up myself,

9
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,590
for the first time, really helped
me get a better grasp of it.

10
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:26,440
I hope it helps you too.
